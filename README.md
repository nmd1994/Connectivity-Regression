# Connectivity-Regression

# Overview

The main analysis can be conducted (for both Real and Simulated Data seen in the manuscript) with the permutation hypothesis test and the bootstrap based stability selection procedure. R files are commented to show how to load individual data or the data directly used in the analysis shown in the manuscript.  

# Helper Functions
Helper functions for our framework should be run before running the main analysis. In particular, the GFT_inv_map function provides a fast algorithm for mapping back to the original space of the observed data. 

# Simulations

Recreate the results from manuscript 'Connectivity Regression'. Simulated data used in the main body of the manuscript is available under the Simulations subfolder. Similarly, individuals can upload their own data and run inference. 

Finally, a r-file to assess estimation accuracy from the simulated data is shown under the simulations subfolder. 

# Real Data Analysis

The processed real data is avalaible under the folder Real Data Analysis sub-folder.
