# Connectivity-Regression

# Main Functions

The main analysis can be conducted (for both Real and Simulated Data) with the permutation hypothesis test and the bootstrap based stability selection procedure. R files are commented to show how to load individual data or the data directly used in the analysis shown in the manuscript.  


# Simulations

Recreate the results from manuscript 'Connectivity Regression'. Simulated data used in the main body of the manuscript is available under the Simulations subfolder. Similarly, individuals can upload their own data and run inference. 

Finally, a r-file to assess estimation accuracy from the simulated data is shown under the simulations subfolder. 

# Real Data Analysis

The processed real data is avalaible under the folder Real Data Analysis sub-folder.
